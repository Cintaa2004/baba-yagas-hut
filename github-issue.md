# Feature Proposal: Dual-Signal Comparison Mode

It would be useful to allow the user to generate and display **two signals side-by-side** â€” one fixed and one user-controlled. This would help students better understand **phase difference** and interference by comparing how the phasors move relative to each other in real time.

A toggle or checkbox could activate this feature and optionally display the **difference signal** as well.
